Loops:
    while (true) -> infinite loop
    while (boolean-expression) -> repeat the code until the boolean-expression became false -> first check after do the code
    do while(boolean-expression) -> repeat the code until the boolean-expression became false -> first do the code after check if repeat
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) -> repeat the code a specified number of times -> set the counter variable -> check the boolean-expression -> the counter variable is incremented -> check the boolean-expression

    while:
        Use when you want to repeat an unknown number of times
    do-while:
        Use when you want a loop to repeat an unknown number of times, but at least once
    for:
        Use when you want a loop to repeat a discrete number of times, thought you may know the number at the moment the program is compiled
