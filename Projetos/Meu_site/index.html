                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I was born in 2005, in Campinas a city in the interior of São Paulo, Brasil (in brazilian portuguese this is how we write it).</p>
                    <p>I'm the younger son of my parents, we are just in two and we have two dogs, whose names are Pipoca (that is popcorn in english) and Phoebe (like the girl from Friends).</p>
                    <p>My favorite food is "arroz, feijão, bife e salada", aka rice, beans, beaf and salad, and for dessert I go with lemon pie!</p>
                    <p>I could say my favorite color, but I'm colorblind so it wouldn't be the same for most of people... But if you got curius just look to the orange in the page.</p>
                    <p>Talking about languages, as I'm brazilian I speak portuguese, and for curiosit I started learning english (that is foreign for me), Spanish (that is very similiar to my mother language) and Germany (this is the only one that I don't speak neather understand) and now I'm learning French.</p>
