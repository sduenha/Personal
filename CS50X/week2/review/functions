Functions:
    what is -> is a black box with 1 or more inputs and 1 output
    for what -> organization, simplification, reusability
    declaration -> return-type name(argument-list); -> return-type -> type of the output -> argument-list -> inputs to the function
    definitions -> make that function works when it is call
    calls -> pass the arguments and assign its return value to a variable of the correct type
    miscellany -> functions with no inputs must be declare as having a void argument list -> with no output works the same way
