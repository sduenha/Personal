Recursion
    What is? -> a recursive function is one that, as part of its execution, invokes itself.

    Has to have! -> This kind of function has two cases that could apply, given any input:
                        - The base case, which when triggered will terminate the recusive process.
                        - The recursive case, which is where the recursion will actually occur. 
    
    Not always -> recursive function replace loops in non-recursive functions

    You can have -> it is possible to have more than one base or recursive case
