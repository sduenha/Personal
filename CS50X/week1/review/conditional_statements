Conditional Statements:
    if -> first boolean-expression is true execute this code -> first boolean-expression is false don't execute this code
    else -> none boolean-expressions are true execute this code
    else if -> secound boolean-expression is true execute this code
    switch statement -> permits enumeration of discrete cases -> has to break in the end of each case or you will fall through each one
    ternary operator -> if-else on the vertical -> int x = (expr) ? 5 : 6; -> if the expression is true x = 5, if is false x = 6

    if:
        Use boolena expressions to make decisions
    switch:
        Use discrete cases to maka decisions
    ternary operator (?;):
        Use to replace a very simple if-else, making our code fancy
