Arrays:
    what is -> are data structure
    uses -> uses for hold values of the same type at contiguous memory locations
    first element of an array -> position 0
    last element of an array -> postion -1
    array declaration -> type name[size]; -> size is how many elements you would like your array to contain
    declaring and initializing an array simultaneously -> int array[4] = { true, false, true, false};
    functions receive the actual array not a copy of it
