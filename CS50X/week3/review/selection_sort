Selection Sort
    Idea -> find the smallest unsorted element and add it to the end of the sorted list.

    Pseudocode -> Repeat until no unsorted elements remain:
                    - Search the unsorted part of the data to find the smallest value
                    - Swap the smallest found value with the first element of the unsorted part

    Worst-case scenario -> We have to iterate over each of the n elements of the array (to find the smallest unsorted element) and we must repeat this process n times, since only one element gets sorted on each pass. O(n²)

    Best-case scenario -> Exactly the same! There's no way to guarantee the array is sorted until we go through this process for all the elements. Ω(n²)
