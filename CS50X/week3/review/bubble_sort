Bubble Sort
    Idea -> move higher valued elements generally towards the right and lower value elements generally towards the left.

    Pseudocode -> Set swap counter to a non-zero value
                  Repeat until the swap counter is 0;
                    - Reset swap counter to 0
                    - Look at each adjacent pair
                        - If two adjacent elements are not in order, swap them and add one to the swap counter
    
    Worst-case scenario -> The array is in reverse order; we have to "bubble" each of the n elements all the way across the array, and since we can only fully bubble one element into position pwe pass, we must do this n times. O(n²)

    Best-case scenario -> The array is already perfectly sorted, and we make no swaps on the first pass. Ω(n)
