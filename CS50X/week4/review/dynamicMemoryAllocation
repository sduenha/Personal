Dynamic Memory Allocation
    -> Use points to get access to a block of this memory at runtime
    -> This memory comes from a pool of memory known as the "heap"
    -> The memory that we were used to use were from the "stack" 

    How to get this Dynamic-allocated memory
        -> By making a call to the C standard library function malloc(), passing as its parameter the number of bytes requested
        -> After obtaining memory for you (if it can), malloc() will return a pointer to that memory
        -> If it can't give you memory it will hand you back NULL
    
    Important
        -> This new type of memory do not return automatically to the system, what can result in a memory leak
        -> After use the dynamically-allocated memory you must "free()" it
        => Do not "free()" a block of memory more than once
