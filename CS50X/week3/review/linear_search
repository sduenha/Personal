Linear Search
    Idea -> iterate across the array from left to right, searching for a specified element
    
    Pseudocode -> Repeat, starting at the first element:
                    If the first element is what you're looking for, stop.
                    Otherwise, move to the next element.
    
    Worst-case scenario -> We have to look throgh the entire array of n elements, either because the target element is the last element of the array or doesn't exist in the array at all. O(n)

    Best-case scenario -> The target element is the first element of the array, and so we can stop looking immediately after we start.       Î©(1)
